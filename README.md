VBA_Challenge homework for Mod 2
##Overview of Project
In this project we were asked to help Steve make his data run faster using VBA script and refactoring the code given. 
###Purpose
Steve wanted to show his parents a little more research in his data to show the entire stockmarket over the years of 2017 and 2018. 
##Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of VBA_Challenge2017 
In the analysis for All Stocks 2017 we can see that the only 2 stocks that turn out positive will be ENPH and RUN, whereas the other stocks are all negative


### Analysis of VBA_Challenge2018
I was unable to complete the script for this due to my VBA script giving me an error me and my classmates could not figure out.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code in general
The advantages of refactoring code is that it can make it easier, quicker, and more efficient to retrieve the data that a person is looking for specifically like in Steve's case.
The disadvantages of refactoring code is that there are many things that can go wrong and errors you can get, if even a single letter or capitzalization is out of place then it will give you an error code and can take time and energy to perfect it and get it right so it will run
### Advantages and Disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
The obvious advantage of the refactored VBA script would be that it runs quicker for Steve to show off to his parents 
The disadvantage of the refactored VBA script is that there is too much room to create an error with the script, unless you are well versed in VBA script writing it can be difficult and frustrating when the script you wrote keeps getting errors and doesn't work.
